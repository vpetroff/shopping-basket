### Shopping cart app instructions

Unzip, and run the following in a console in the directory where you unzipped the app:

```
npm install
npm start
```
Open your favourite browser and point it to [localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300/)
Sit back and enjoy (or play with the form, if Bootstrap is too mundane for you :)
